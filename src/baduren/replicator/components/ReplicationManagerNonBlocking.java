/**
 * The class <code>ReplicationManagerNonBlocking</code> introduces the
 * possibility to call many replicas but returning the first result while
 * letting the other (repeated) computations terminating (not possible with
 * <code>invokeAny</code>, an important behaviour when using replication for
 * fault-tolerance.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The call mode <code>FIRST</code> and its implementation in the method
 * <code>call</code> shows how to perform this kind of waiting. Some care is
 * taken to partition the exceptions between the ones that result from a
 * malfunctioning server and the ones that result from a wrong computation.
 * The latter must be thrown to the caller but the former should trigger
 * fault-tolerance actions which are not implemented here.
